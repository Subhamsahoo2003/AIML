A hands-on journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This repository documents practical exercises, foundational algorithms, and real-world projectsâ€”with a focus on mastering NumPy and core ML concepts from scratch

NUMPY
Day-01:- working with numpy, what i learned in numpy are:-
           i.working with arrays- creattion,manipulation,efficent indexing etc..
           ii.mathematical operation-practise element wise operation,broadcasting,aggregation and linear algebra routines.
           iii.performance matters:using vectorization and understanding memory layout to write fasr,clean and reliable code.
